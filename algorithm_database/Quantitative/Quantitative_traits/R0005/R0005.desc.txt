Name: Lung cancer
Chinese name: 肺癌
Description: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide in both men and women. Although it has long been recognized that lung cancer runs strongly in families, the specific genes that are responsible for enhanced risk are just starting to be revealed. Identifying genes responsible for lung cancer before the era of GWAS has been limited. Candidate susceptibility genes coding for enzymes involved in the activation, detoxification and repair of damages caused by tobacco smoke as well as genes in inflammatory and cell-cycle pathways have been extensively studied. Many of these candidate gene studies are either preliminary or controversial. GWAS have evolved from finding lung cancer loci per se, to a more refined search strategy focused on specific subgroups of lung cancer patients. Advances in analysis strategies were also achieved moving from single marker analyses to pathway-based and variant prioritization approaches. GWAS have also been performed to find genetic loci associated with lung cancer survival, response to conventional therapies, and multiple sites of cancer. GWAS by environmental exposures and genome-wide epistasis analyses are also emerging.
