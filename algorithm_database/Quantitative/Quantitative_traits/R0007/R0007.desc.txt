Name: Schizophrenia
Chinese name: 精神分裂症
Description: "Schizophrenia is a common and serious psychiatric illness affecting 0.5–1% of the population in early adulthood. The disease remains incurable, with the best outcome being the control of symptoms and preservation of sufficient functionality and independence. Schizophrenia is a disease with remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity. The symptoms are generally divided into three categories: positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and cognitive symptoms. Each patient can have a different mix of the three types of symptoms leading to an overall highly heterogeneous phenotype. Affective symptoms may combine with the classic symptoms of schizophrenia leading to schizoaffective disorder, which some genetic researchers categorize with schizophrenia and others with bipolar disorder (BD). It has long been recognized that schizophrenia runs in families, noted in the first detailed description of the disease by Bleuler in 1911. Formally, the heritability of the disease has been calculated at > 80%, making genetic makeup the most important factor for developing the disease."
