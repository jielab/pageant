Name: Lactose metabolism
Chinese name: 乳糖代谢能力
Description: "Lactose, a sugar in milk, is broken down by the enzyme lactase which our bodies produce in the small intestines. For some people, the production of the lactase enzyme stops when they become an adult, driven by a genetic variation near the LCT gene. This means some adults are genetically predisposed to not be able to digest larger quantities of milk. Producing lactase as an adult is the most common genotype for Caucasian populations, while in Asian populations, the majority do not produce lactase as an adult. A theory for this occurrence seems to be an adaptation by Caucasian populations in Europe who relied on dairy products as a source of protein. For people with European Caucasian ancestry, the main variant to look at is rs4988235. It is located in the MCM6 gene, which influences the LCT gene.  Approximately 90% of Caucasians will have A/A or A/G and still produce lactase to break down milk as an adult. In Asian populations, less than one percent will carry the G allele. People with African ancestry may find that they carry a different variant (rs145946881) in the MCM6 gene that also causes lactase persistence as an adult."
