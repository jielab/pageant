Disease description: "Age-related macular degeneration, also known as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), is an aging change in the structure of the macular area.This disease is characterized by retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choroid lesions in the macular retina and the subretinal vegetative structures that lead to progressive visual dysfunction and central vision loss.The prevalence of AMD in China keeps rising and increases with the increase of the age of the patients, and the disease has become the main cause of irreversible visual impairment in the elderly population in China.There was no significant difference in the prevalence of AMD between men and women.Data from September 2002 to June 2003 showed that the prevalence of AMD was 15.5% in people aged ≥50 years in Caojiadu Street, Jing 'an District, Shanghai, with wet AMD accounting for 11.9%.In 1998, the prevalence rate of AMD among people over 50 years old in Doumen County, Guangdong was 8.4%, among which the detection rate of AMD among patients aged 50-59 years old, 60-69 years old and over 70 years old was 2.9%, 7.8% and 12.9%, respectively.The prevalence of AMD in some economically developed regions of China is close to the level of western developed countries."
