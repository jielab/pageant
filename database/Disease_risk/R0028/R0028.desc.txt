Name: Coronary artery disease
Chinese name: 冠状动脉疾病
Description: "Coronary artery disease is a disease caused by damage to the coronary arteries.The disease is usually associated with plaque buildup and inflammation of the blood vessels that contain lipids.As plaque builds up, the diameter of the coronary arteries that allow blood to circulate decreases, thereby reducing the flow of blood, oxygen and nutrients.Eventually, a decrease in blood flow can cause chest pain, shortness of breath, or other symptoms.A complete blockage of a coronary artery can cause a heart attack.The incidence of the disease is 5 to 9 percent in people 20 years of age and older.The mortality rate increased with age and was higher in males than females, especially in the 35-55 age group.After the age of 55, the death rate for men declined, but for women it continued to rise.After the ages of 70 to 75, women die at a higher rate than men of the same age.Coronary artery disease affects people of all RACES, but it is particularly prevalent in black and Southeast Asian populations."
