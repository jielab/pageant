Name: Atrial fibrillation
Chinese name: 心房颤动
Description: "Atrial fibrillation, also known as atrial fibrillation, atrial fibrillation, is a kind of abnormal heart rhythm/arrhythmia, characterized by the rapid and irregular beating of the heart.Atrial fibrillation may initially last for a relatively short period of time, but the duration of the attack may become longer and may not even be alleviated.Most episodes are asymptomatic, and sometimes the patient may experience palpitations, fainting, difficulty breathing, and chest pain.Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of heart failure, dementia and stroke.The epidemiological data of atrial fibrillation in China show that the prevalence rate of atrial fibrillation in China is 0.77%, and the prevalence rate in males (0.9%) is higher than that in females (0.7%). It is estimated that there are more than 10 million patients with atrial fibrillation in China.Atrial fibrillation mainly occurs in the elderly with organic heart disease, a small number of patients with atrial fibrillation without any organic heart disease, known as isolated atrial fibrillation."
