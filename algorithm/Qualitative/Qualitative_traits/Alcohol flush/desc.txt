Name: Alcohol flush
Chinese name: 酒精性脸红
Description: In African and European populations, acetaldehyde is broken down quickly enough to maintain tolerably low concentrations in drinkers. In east Asian populations, there is a common loss-of-function variant of the ALDH2 gene on chromosome 12 (rs671). Even a single copy decreases acetaldehyde breakdown enough for the concentration to become uncomfortably high after drinking alcohol. This variant is an important determinant of the east Asian flushing reaction to alcohol, and of alcohol intake. Less importantly, a genetic variant of the ADH1B gene on chromosome 4 (rs1229984) that is common in east Asia increases alcohol clearance rates. Together, these two single nucleotide polymorphisms strongly affect alcohol exposure, and each has been shown to decrease substantially the incidence of alcoholism. Both variants involve a G→A mutation, with the A allele decreasing alcohol exposure. Each variant has three possible genotypes, AA, AG, and GG, so the two variants define nine possible genotypes. Alcohol intake is affected more by the decreased rate of breakdown of acetaldehyde than by the increased alcohol clearance rate. Hence, when describing these nine genotypes the rs671 genotype is given first and the rs1229984 genotype second, and alphabetic order corresponds to increasing alcohol intake: AA/AA, AA/AG, AA/GG; then AG/AA, AG/AG, AG/GG; then GG/AA, GG/AG, GG/GG. We denote this 9 genotype as A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, respectively.
