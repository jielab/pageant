Name: FTO related obesity
Chinese name: FTO相关的肥胖
Description: "In 2007, within a time period of three months, two studies claimed the discovery of FTO as the first GWAS-identified obesity-susceptibility gene. FTO was first discovered through a GWAS of type 2 diabetes in Europeans, comparing 1,924 cases and 2,938 controls. A cluster of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the first intron of the gene showed highly significant association with risk of type 2 diabetes. However, after adjusting for BMI, the association with type 2 diabetes completely abolished, suggesting that the FTO - type 2 diabetes association was mediated through FTO’s effect on BMI. Eight weeks after the first discovery, a GWAS for BMI in 4,741 Sardinians observed highly significant associations for SNPs from the same intronic cluster in FTO, which was subsequently replicated in 2,335 European and Hispanic Americans. A third study, published at around the same time as the two GWAS, identified the same FTO locus serendipitously, while testing for population stratification in their case-control obesity data. Together, these studies firmly established FTO as the first gene with common variants that affect obesity susceptibility in the general population. Although the mechanism and function of FTO is not fully understood, possible functional alterations by the gene have been reported in the HPA axis and in the reward system in the brain."
