Name: Marital satisfaction
Chinese name: 婚姻满意度
Description: Based on a study from Makhanova, A. at el. published in February 2021, a research team from the University of Arkansas, Florida State University, and McGill University collected data from 71 heterosexual newlywed couples (N = 142 participants) in their early 30s. Within three months of getting married, couples completed a series of baseline measures. Over the next three years, both partners completed measures of marital satisfaction every four months, along with saliva samples for DNA extraction. Those who had the rs3796863 CC genotype reported greater marital satisfaction, compared to those with the AC/AA type. In addition, those with the CC genotype also reported more trust, forgiveness, and gratitude toward their relationship partner. These associations were the same for men and women. It’s also important to realize that any genetic marker associated with a behavior — in this case marital satisfaction — isn’t causal. That is, every person with this CC genotype won’t be great at relationships. And every person without it won’t be hopeless when it comes to love. Genes aren’t destiny. But this research does show that there are genetic underpinnings to our behavior.
