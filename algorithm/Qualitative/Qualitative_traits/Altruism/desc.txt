Name: Altruism
Chinese name: 利他主义
Description: William D. Hamilton postulated the existence of ‘genes underlying altruism’, under the rubric of inclusive fitness theory, a half-century ago. Humans are by nature prosocial. Nevertheless, prosocial behavior is greatly variable among individuals. By far the best-studied polymorphism within COMT is the Val158Met polymorphism (rs4680). It has long been known that there is a trimodal distribution of COMT activity in human populations (Floderus et al., 1981), which was subsequently shown to be due to the presence of this polymorphism (Lachman et al., 1996). The polymorphism is an A to G single nucleotide change that results in a valine to methionine substitution at position 158 of the MB-COMT amino acid sequence (position 108 in S-COMT Bertocci et al., 1991; Lundstrom et al., 1991). The Met158 form of COMT has a lower thermostability and therefore a lower activity at 37˚C, compared to the Val158 form (Chen et al., 2004; Lotta et al., 1995). The apparent differences in the magnitude of the Val158Met effect on activity are likely due in part to methodological factors, but could plausibly also be due to tissue-specific effects of other polymorphisms/haplotypes in COMT.
