Name: HIV resistance
Chinese name: HIV抗性
Description: Host genetic factors are involved in resistance/susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and progression. The most relevant genetic variant of the gene encoding HIV-1 major co- receptor, CCR5 (chemokine receptor type 5). The CCR5 gene codes for a protein on the cell membrane of white blood cells, specifically T-cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, eosinophils, and microglial cells. It is a part of your immune system’s response to foreign invaders, and it is also an essential part of the way that the HIV virus is able to hijack immune cells. A mutation in CCR5, named Delta 32 (rs333), causes a change in the protein that makes it non-functional. Carrying two copies of the mutation protects most carriers from HIV. The first person in the world to be cured of HIV, the “Berlin Patient“, was Timothy Ray Brown, an American living in Berlin. While HIV positive, he contracted leukemia, and in 2007 he was given a bone marrow transplant from a donor with two copies of the CCR5 Delta32 mutation. After 3 months, he no longer had detectable HIV in his blood. The Delta32 variant is well studied on a variety of immune system topics. It is thought that the mutation first arose in Northern Europe and was preferentially passed on in Caucasian populations due to increasing resistance to smallpox.
