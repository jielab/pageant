Description: Abundant data from twin and adoption studies provide evidence for the heritability of habitual cigarette smoking. Hall et al. reviewed twin and adoption data in smoking studies, including five studies of twins reared apart. Taken together, these twin studies suggest that a majority of NA risk is attributable to genetic factors. More recent twin smoking research suggests that the heritability of NA is ∼75%. In 2008, Berrettini et al. described a GWAS of ∼7000 individuals of European origin for CPD, with a P-value ∼10−5, at a CHRNA3 SNP allele. They studied a second population of equal size, for the same phenotype (CPD), reporting association to a second allele in the same haplotype, establishing the common European haplotype as conferring risk for Nicotine addition. The CHRNA5/A3/B4 is a gene cluster on chromosome 15 that encodes the α5, α3, and β4 of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits (nAChR) (Duga et al., 2001; Eng, Kozak, Beaudet, & Zoghbi, 1991). Genome-wide association studies have shown strong associations between tobacco smoking dependence and genetic variations in the CHRNA5/A3/B4 gene cluster (Saccone et al., 2007; Wen, Yang, Cui, & Li, 2016). One single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) that showed strong relation to tobacco smoking behavior/dependence is rs16969968 in exon 5 of CHRNA5.
