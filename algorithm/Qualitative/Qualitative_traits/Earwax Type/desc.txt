Name: Earwax Type
Chinese name: 耳垢类型
Disease description: Earwax, also known as "cerumen," is produced by glands that line the ear canal. It gradually moves out of the ear, carrying dead skin cells and other debris. Most people have one of two types of earwax. Wet earwax is sticky and yellowish brown to dark brown in color, while dry earwax is crumbly and gray to tan. A small number of people, generally less than 1 percent, have earwax that is intermediate or unclassifiable. Variation at a single gene determines which kind of earwax a person has. The allele for wet earwax is dominant over the allele for dry earwax. The allele for dry earwax appears to have originated by mutation in northeastern Asia about 2,000 generations ago, then spread outwards because it was favored by natural selection. It is very common in eastern Asia, becomes much less common towards Europe, and is very rare in Africa. Tomita et al. (2002) used eight Japanese families to determine that the gene for wet/dry earwax is on chromosome 16, near the centromere. Yoshiura et al. (2006) then found the gene responsible: ABCC11 (ATP-binding cassette, subfamily C, member 11). The allele for wet earwax has a G at site 538 of the coding region, which causes a glycine at position 180 in the amino acid sequence; most dry alleles have an A at site 538, coding for arginine.
