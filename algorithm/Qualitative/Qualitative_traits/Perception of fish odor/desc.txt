Name: Perception of fish odor
Chinese name: 鱼腥味敏感度
Description: The perception of smell is enabled by olfactory receptors, which are proteins that bind odor molecules. Olfactory senses are one of the oldest and most critical senses for the organism survival that helps in identifying food, potential mating partners, as well as dangers. Due to the variation in the number of olfactory receptors in the species, different species have different olfactory abilities. These olfactory receptors (OR) are encoded by OR genes. In humans out of 855 OR genes, only ~400 were functionally coded for ORs. The genetic variation in the OR genes among individuals provides the personalized olfaction behaviour among individuals. A number of association studies for odor perception with genetic OR loci are reported. Also, a recent genome-wide association study was performed by Gisladottir et al. for odor perception on 9,122 Icelanders. They found three genetic variants i.e. p.Ser95Pro in TAAR5 gene (rs41286168), p.Lys233Asn in OR6C70 (rs60683621) and intergenic variant rs317787 associated with aversion to fish odor, increased intensity of licorice, and cinnamon odor respectively.
