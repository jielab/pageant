Name: ABO blood type
Chinese name: ABO 血型
Description: The ABO blood types were discovered by Karl Landsteiner in 1901. He received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930 for this discovery. ABO blood types are also present in other primates such as apes and Old World monkeys. The ABO blood group system is used to denote the presence of one, both, or neither of the A and B antigens on erythrocytes. In human blood transfusions it is the most important of the 38 different blood type (or group) classification systems currently recognized. A mismatch  in this, or any other serotype, can cause a potentially fatal adverse reaction after a transfusion, or an unwanted immune response to an organ transplant. The associated anti-A and anti-B antibodies are usually IgM antibodies, produced in the first years of life by sensitization to environmental substances such as food, bacteria, and viruses. Usually, four tag SNPs were used for the main ABO blood group antigens (rs8176746 for B, rs687289 for O, rs507666 for A1 and rs8176704 for A2).
