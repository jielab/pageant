Name: Caffeine metabolism
Chinese name: 咖啡因代谢
Description: "Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) is one of the most widely used drugs in the world and is available in many mediums for consumption. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of caffeine have been well studied. Caffeine metabolism occurs primarily in the liver via the cytochrome P450 system (CYP1A2). The CYP1A2 proteins are encoded by the CYP1A2 gene, and CYP1A2 activity is induced when aromatic hydrocarbons bind the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. The CYP1A2 gene encodes a member of the cytochrome p450 family of proteins, which metabolize nutrients and drugs. One well known substrate of CYP1A2 is caffeine. The same amount of caffeine will therefore tend to have more stimulating effect on CYP1A2 slow metabolizers than on CYP1A2 fast metabolizers. The SNP rs762551, also known as -164A>C or -163C>A, encodes the CYP1A2*1F allele of the CYP1A2 gene. The C allele is considered the wild-type, even though it is the rarer allele in most populations. AA = CYP1A2*1F = Fast Metabolizer. CC, AC = CYP1A2*1C = Slow Metabolizer."
