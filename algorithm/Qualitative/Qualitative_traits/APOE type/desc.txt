Name: APOE type
Chinese name: APOE基因型
Description: The APOE gene provides instructions for making a protein called apolipoprotein E. This protein combines with fats (lipids) in the body to form molecules called lipoproteins. Lipoproteins are responsible for packaging cholesterol and other fats and carrying them through the bloodstream. Maintaining normal levels of cholesterol is essential for the prevention of disorders that affect the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular diseases), including heart attack and stroke.
There are at least three slightly different versions (alleles) of the APOE gene. The major alleles are called e2, e3, and e4. The most common allele is e3, which is found in more than half of the general population. APOE is also the most common gene associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease. APOE e3 doesn't seem to affect the risk of Alzheimer's. APOE e4 increases the risk while APOE e2 decrease the risk. The three alleles of the human apolipoprotein E gene arise from 2 SNPs: rs7412 and rs429358. An individual with the E2 (epsilon 2 or ε2) allele has a "T" nucleotide at both SNPs. The E3 (epsilon 3 or ε3) allele is the most common allele, with an estimated ~78% of the population having this variant of the APOE gene. This APOE genotype is the result of a "C" nucleotide at the rs7412 SNP and a "T" nucleotide at the rs429358 SNP. The E4 allele (epsilon 4 allele or APOE ε4) is characterized by a "C" nucleotide at both the rs7412 and rs429358 SNPs. Though only present in about 14% of the population, nearly 40% of Alzheimer's disease patients have a copy of this Apolipoprotein E allele. Individuals that inherit the APOE 4 allele from both parents may have 20 times higher risk of developing Alzheimer's.
